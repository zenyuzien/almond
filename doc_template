/**
 * @brief Performs fast matrix multiplication.
 * @details
 * This function uses Strassen's algorithm to perform matrix multiplication
 * in sub-cubic time. It is suitable for large square matrices where
 * traditional O(n^3) methods are too slow. 
 * 
 * For small matrices, this may be slower due to recursion overhead.
 *
 * @param A First matrix.
 * @param B Second matrix.
 * @return Product matrix.

 /**
 * @file matrix_math.cpp
 * @brief Implements core matrix operations such as multiplication and inversion.
 * @details
 * This file contains optimized routines for matrix manipulation, used in
 * scientific computing modules. All functions assume well-formed square matrices
 * unless stated otherwise.
