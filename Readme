This project is intended to be the first compiler prototype for targetting 
the Custom ISA of the AI processor project.

At the time of starting this project, the ISA spec is not formally on paper yet.
Consequently, the project will target x86 

For the front-end, a subset of C programming language is being parsed. 
So in short, this project is a generic prototype for 
C -> x86, being written in basic Cpp

roughly 3 phases for the prototype:
1. Lexer
2. Parser
3. Codegen - x86 

The current phase as of June '25 is in 'Parsing'
The expected time to finish the prototype is early August.
